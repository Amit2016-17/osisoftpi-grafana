# PI Web API Datasource for Grafana

## Installation

Copy the contents of the "dist" folder to your Grafana plugin directory into a folder called "osisoft-piwebapi-datasource".

## Usage

Create a new instance of the data source from the Grafana Data Sources administration page.

It is recommended to use "proxy" access settings. You may need to add "Basic" authentication to your PIWebAPI server configuration and add credentials to the data source settings.
